# hotel-reservation-database

This was the first project we did in the Data-Driven-Web-Applications portion of my Apprenticeship at the Software Guild.
This project contains 3 SQL script files written in MySQL Workbench 8.0 and one ERD diagram of the tables in the database.
This project capped off an entire week of learning about SQL and relational databases. There is no program to persist data into 
this database -- data for the queries was inserted directly within workbench.

```DaleDybvigHotelDB.sql``` contains the SQL DDL language to create the database and tables.

```DaleDybvigHotelData.sql``` contains the SQL DML language to insert data into the database manually in order to query it later.

```DaleDybvigHotelQueries.sql``` contains the queries specified by the project requirements. It was a great way to practice 
outer joins. By the end of it I found I could write most of a join query without having to check an example!
